This Solidity code defines a simple smart contract for a token called **MyToken**. Here's a breakdown of what each part does:

### 1. **Public Variables:**
- `tokenName = "TOKEN"`: The name of the token is "TOKEN".
- `tokenAbbrv = "TKN"`: The abbreviation for the token is "TKN".
- `totalSupply = 0`: This keeps track of the total number of tokens in circulation. It starts at 0.

### 2. **Mapping Balances:**
- `mapping(address => uint) public balances`: This is a mapping (like a dictionary) that links each address (similar to an account) to its balance of tokens. It shows how many tokens each person or address owns.

### 3. **Mint Function (Creating Tokens):**
- `function mint(address _address, uint _value)`: 
   - This function **creates new tokens**.
   - It takes two inputs: the `_address` (the person who will receive the tokens) and `_value` (the number of tokens to create).
   - It **increases** the `totalSupply` by the `_value` (the number of tokens created).
   - It also **adds** the same number of tokens to the balance of the `_address`.

### 4. **Burn Function (Destroying Tokens):**
- `function burn(address _address, uint _value)`:
   - This function **destroys tokens**.
   - It takes two inputs: the `_address` (the person whose tokens will be destroyed) and `_value` (the number of tokens to remove).
   - It first checks if the address has enough tokens to burn (`if (balances[_address] >= _value)`).
   - If the balance is sufficient, it **decreases** the `totalSupply` by the `_value` and **subtracts** the same number from the balance of the `_address`.

### Summary:
- **Minting** creates new tokens, increasing the total supply and adding tokens to a user's balance.
- **Burning** destroys tokens, reducing the total supply and taking tokens from a user's balance, but only if the user has enough tokens to burn.
